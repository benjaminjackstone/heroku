casing and naming conventions are important**

CREATE TABLE people( #tied directly to a resource so name it accordingly(plural) after collection
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, #field that is the unique identifier. auto-increment provides for a oneup serialization to avoid race conditions and complications. sqlite doesn't have auto-increment specifier but takes care of this due the its type
	name VARCHAR(0-255) NOT NULL, #up to this value in bytes. not wasting space.
	age 	INTEGER
);

.tables # to list all tables
.schema <table_name> # to find the values when table was created
INSERT INTO people (name, age) VALUES ("bj", 31); #id is auto-generated by the database cause its primary key. needs name becuase it can't be NULL. don't need the age because we never specified it can't be nULL

SELECT * is misunderstood.  its the keyword that is read-only data. the * means 'all fields' not all rows.
	queries apply to all rows unless otherwise specified
SELECT * FROM people WHERE age < 100;
	WHERE is the kwyword that constrains the rows.
